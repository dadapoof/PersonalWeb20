Identify what aspects of the work have been correctly implemented and what have not:
- I believe that all the guidelines discussed in the assignment have been met. I have not used any other frameworks or languages and my HTML/CSS pages pass the validators.
- I also believe that I was able to redirect my Tufts CS website (~dmassa01) to my github.io.
- Lastly, I have the 3 pages required for my personal website: index.html, bio.html, resume.html.

I've discussed the assignment with certain TAs (ie. Manish Aryal, Kingsley...) and discussed general designs with Henry Li and Armanc Keser (two students in COMP20).

I've spent approximately 5-7 hours completing the assignment.
