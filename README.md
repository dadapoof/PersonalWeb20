Identify what aspects of the work have been correctly implemented and what have not:
- I believe that all the guidelines discussed in the assignment have been met. I have not used any other frameworks or languages and my HTML/CSS pages pass the validators.
- 

I've discussed the assignment with certain TAs (ie. Manish Aryal...) and discussed general designs with Henry Li and Armanc Kesser (two students in COMP20).

I've spent approximately 7-9 hours completing the assignment.
