        <h2>My Biography</h2>
        <h5>Hi! My name is David Massart. I'm currently a sophomore at Tufts University, majoring in Computer Science. 
        <br /><br />
        Some Fun Things About Me:<br /><br />
        1. I am trilingual: I speak English, French, and Spanish fluently. I am currently learning Intermediate Japanese at my University. That being said, I am no stranger to foreign languages. <br />
        2. I had a 3-day internship in HighSchool at Sunrise Solar Solutions. I helped sell Solar Panels so if you ever need to sell Solar Panels, I'm your guy.<br />
        3. <br />

        <br /><br />
        There are 4 things I want to accomplish in life:<br />

        1. Write a book: I like books. I want to write a book. Maybe about Computer Science. Maybe not. I'll see.<br />
        2. Plant a tree: Creating life that doesn't complain every day should be pretty nice.<br />
        3. Have a startup: I don't know what the startup will be but I'll make it work. Somehow.<br />
        4. Have my own restaurant: For now, I want to go to Japan and Switzerland to learn how to make ramen, crepes, and fondue, it's really good.
        <br /><br />
        Why Computer Science? <br />
        There's really only one good reason and it's <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=recursion">recursion</a>
